# An analysis of STATS19 data

# Research questions
These questions are inspired by the diverse literature on risk and cycling and guided by 
knowledge about the STATS19 dataset in terms of the types of research question it can 
and cannot answer. There are many interesting research questions about risk and cycling that
STATS19 cannot help answer (e.g. how do drivers' perceptions of cyclists affect the probability
of collision? and what influence does experience have on the cyclist crashes?) because 
the variables about which it provides information are quite focussed. However, 
there are many research questions that *can* be investigated by STATS19 data that
are important and remain under-researched using quantitative methods. 
A selection of some of the most relevant hypotheses to policy makers 
that can be tackled by analysis of STATS19 data are presented below, 
in rough descending order of importance and ascending order of complexity:

- Is seasonal variability of traffic accidents different for cyclists than for other road users?
- How has the spatial and temporal distribution of accidents involving cyclists changed over time?
- Is there evidence that certain geographic and infrastructure features are especially linked to high rates of cyclist accidents? 

# Literature review: previous work on the spatial distribution of cycle accidents

# Method
Whilst the application of this research is targetted firmly towards sustainable transport
planning and evaluation, the methods fit within the field of applied geography and spatial 
analysis, making the paper inter-disciplinary. As with most applied problems, 
the method here is firmly routed in the input data, which is spatio-temporal data
with a range of associated nominal and ordinal characteristics linked to the circumstances
of the incident and the entities involved. Thus the main tools for analysis, beyond 
standard tools for statistical analysis of the non spatial data (in the case of 
comparing accidents involving cyclists with those not involving cyclists...), are 
thus taken from the field of *spatial point pattern analysis*. 

This field has applications in many fields, notably ecology and spatial epidemiology, 
which involves "comparing the spatial distribution of the cases [of disease] to the 
locations of a set of controls taken at random from the population (Bivand et al. 2013, p. 173)."
The analogy to cycling is clear: STATS19 data are reported simply points on the map 
with attributes. In order to answer the research questions outlined above, we must
compare this spatial distribution with that expected from the null hypothesis: that 
accidents involving cyclists are randomly distributed over the road network.

# Results

## Basic statistics cycle accidents in the UK

Over the entire study period, the proportion of accidents involving bicycles rose from xx % in 

## The timing of bicycle accidents

The temporal distribution of bicycle accidents is highly correlated with that of 
road accidents overall (correlation)

Season

In terms of time of day, bicycle accidents have a 'peakier' distribution 
that all road traffic accidents, with the accident density during the afternoon
rush hour almost 50% higher for cyclists than non cyclists (fig. x).
