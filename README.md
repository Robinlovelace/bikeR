# bikeR - a repository for studying risk to people on bicycles, using R

Welcome to bikeR, a store of code and example data underlying research
into cycling and the associated risks.

The main branch of this work so far has been an analysis of
[STATS19](http://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data),
resulting in the following paper, now published in the journal
[Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136984781500039X)
(Lovelace et al. 2015):

Of course, an open access version of the pdf is available online,
[here](http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/83930/). The source code used
to generate the paper can be found
[here](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/bikeR/blob/master/stat19.Rmd).

## The reasons for putting this research online are:

- To allow others to perform the analysis conducted by me for West Yorkshire
for other parts of Great Britain and perhaps the world, without
[reinventing the wheel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel):

- To help people learn R in general, an open source language for empowering
oneself with the tools to extract meaning from data and make visualisations, 
like this one - see ([Lovelace and Cheshire 2014](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R)):

To be specific, the code used to produce this map in R can be found here:
[github.com/Robinlovelace/bikeR/blob/master/stat19/whereWards.R](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/bikeR/blob/master/stat19/whereWards.R)

- To encourage reproducibility, a conerstone of scientific research
(Ince et al. 2013).
