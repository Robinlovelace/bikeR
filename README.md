bikeR - a repository for studying risk to people on bicycles, using R
================

## Note

**If you are looking to do reproducible road traffic safety research,
please check out the [`stats19`
package](https://itsleeds.github.io/stats19/) and accompanying paper
(Lovelace et al. 2019).**

## Introduction

Welcome to bikeR, a store of code and example data underlying research
into cycling and the associated risks.

The main branch of this work so far has been an analysis of
[STATS19](http://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data),
resulting in a paper published in the journal [Transportation Research
Part F: Traffic Psychology and
Behaviour](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136984781500039X)
(Lovelace, Roberts, and Kellar 2016).

Of course, an open access version of the pdf is available online,
[here](http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/83930/). The source code used to
generate the paper can be found
[here](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/bikeR/blob/master/stat19.Rmd).

## The reasons for putting this research online are:

  - To allow others to perform the analysis conducted by me for West
    Yorkshire for other parts of Great Britain and perhaps the world,
    without [reinventing the
    wheel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel).

  - To help people learn R in general, an open source language for
    empowering oneself with the tools to extract meaning from data and
    make visualisations, like this one - see [(Lovelace, Nowosad, and
    Meunchow 2019)](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R):

To be specific, the code used to produce this map in R can be found
here:
[github.com/Robinlovelace/bikeR/blob/master/stat19/whereWards.R](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/bikeR/blob/master/stat19/whereWards.R)

  - To encourage reproducibility, a conerstone of scientific research,
    in downloading road data (Padgham et al. 2017)
