bikeR - Risks of cycling from accident and survey data
=====

## Introduction
This project is motivated by the finding that the perceived danger of 
cycling is one of the major barriers of cycling uptake in the UK
(Parkin et al. 2007)
and elsewhere (Fraser and Lock 2011). Although this perceived risk 
is a well established deterrent, little research has been done to 
quantify the details of types of locations where cyclists feel most 
at risk or how this relates to accidents involving cyclists.

## Aim
The aim of this research is to investigate the risks of cycling,
as perceived by cyclists and as inferred from accident data 
and to compare the relationships between these two datasets.

## Objectives
- Analyse the national STATS19 dataset on cycling and find out how 
the characteristics of accidents involving cyclists differ statistically 
from different types of road traffic accident in the UK.
- Collect and analyse cyclists' perceptions of risk on their route to work, 
using GIS software to save the track and add 'danger hotspots'.
- Compare the perceived risk levels with the accident data to find out 
the extent to which they correspond and potential areas where risks
are under and over estimated.
- Draw out policy relevant conclusions from the study about where 
new infrastructure is particularly urgent to make cycling safer and 
inform policies to make cycling more attractive at the local level.

## Workflow
- Preliminary analysis of STATS19 data
- Where people feel at risk - survey data
- Comparison with STATS19 data

## Todo

- Crime survey - underreporting of road accidents?
- Investigate public contribution to perceived risk dataset via 
online map (e.g. see 
[City Connect](http://www.cyclecityconnect.co.uk/participate.php) for interactive map example).
