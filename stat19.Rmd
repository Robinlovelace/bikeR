## Abstract

There has been much recent interest in the factors influencing cycle safety.
Within this broad topic, international differences in accident
and mortality rates, protective equipment and bicycle training have
received particular attention. Within this reseach body there
is a growing interest in environmental factors, but few studies have
focussed on geographical factors at the local level.
This paper addresses this research gap by analysing a geo-referenced
dataset of bicycle accidents, taken from the UK's STATS19 dataset
(2005 - 2012). We investigate incidents involving cyclists
within the case study area of West Yorkshire, an area that
has a historically low cycling rate but very high ambitions
following investment to promote cycling in the area.
Descriptive statistics and statistical tests are used to identify
the characteristic features of bicycle incidents and how they
differ, on average, from other types of crashes.
Spatial statistics are used to characterise the
distribution of injuries to cyclists, allowing inferences about
the relative risks associated with various geographically distributed
features such as roundabouts, junctions, one-way streets, speed limits and cycle paths.
Temporal analysis identifies how these geographical risk factors intersect
with time of day, week and season. Overall we provide evidence to suggest
local-level geographical factors do play an important role in cycle safety
and provide suggestions of how to increase cycle safety and uptake nationwide.

# Introduction

West Yorkshire is not an area associated with cycling.
Although the cities of York and Hull have traditionally high rates of
cycling, Leeds and Bradford have historically low levels of active travel 
and heavily car orientated urban plans.
In recent years there have been efforts to ammend this situation,
and even calls for Leeds (traditionally known as the 'Motorway city')
to become a 'cycling city'. This aspiration received a boost with the
publication of 2011 census data showing that Leeds has seen cycling
grow substantially (by 0.5 percentage points), from 1.4% to 1.9% in 2011.
To put this growth in the national context,
Leeds ranks 34th out of all 324 Enlgish Local Authorities
in terms of cycling and 13th when London is excluded.
In terms of Northern cities, Leeds has seen the fourth
greatest shift to cycling, trailing only Newcastle, Manchester and Sheffield.
Unfortunately, cycling has declined in the other Local Authorities within
West Yorkshire, leading to a highly uneven spatial distribution of
cycling across the county (figure 1).

West Yorkshire is a metropolitan county containing almost 1 million inhabitants
() in an area of xx km2. It thus has a relatively high population density of xx people
per km2, unevenly distributed between the 5 Local Authorities of
Leeds, Bradford, Wakefield, Calderdale and Kirklees that make up the area.
The vast majority of the population is urban, although West Yorksire
also contains tracts of countryside in the form of the Yorkshire Dales to the North
and the
majority of Calderdale and Kirklees to the West (figure 1).

- Definition of a crash as something reported in the STAT19 dataset. What is this specifically?

In terms of geographical research into cycling, there has been much work on the
factors associated with the prevelance of bicycle use (e.g.
[Buehler](http://www.mautc.psu.edu/docs/VT-2009-05.pdf)). Much less has been written
on the determinants of crashes involving cyclists and cyclist's fear of using the road.
These are important oversights because safety concerns have been found to be
the predominant cycling deterrent
([Fishman et al., 2012](http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1369847812000733);
ref Ann Jopson on this...). Thus it is fear of poor
health via accidents which, perversly, prevents cyclists
from enjoying the health benefits of cycling: health benefits
are consistently found to outweigh the costs of cycling,
especially for elderly people who benefit disproportionately from cycling
(ref...)

## Hypotheses

The hypotheses tested in this project were based on the
literature on cyclist safety and fall into three broad
categories: who, where and when.

A conceptual framework for developing hypotheses and
inteventions around road safety was provided by 
Schepers et al. ([2014](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457513001309))...

### Who is most at risk from cycle incidents?

- Young adults (below 30) and the elderly (over 65) will be more likely to crash
([Martinez-Ruiz et al., 2014](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457513004089).
We expected this trend to be stronger in more challenging cycling environments, on large roads.

### Where are crashes most likely to happen?

- We expected unusual and challenging features of
urban infrastructure to be associated with higher than average rate of
cycling than the rest of the road network. Following
([Vandenbulcke et al., 2014](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457513002686),
we specifically expected clusters of incidents
surrounding on-road tram tracks, bridges without cycling facilities,
complex intersections and areas with a high traffic volume.
Also based on this work, we expected cycle infrastructure to reduce risk.
- 

### When are bicycle crashes most likely

- We expect absolute levels of cycle incidents to have remained steady
over time, in line with statistics on the number bicycle commuters
in West Yorkshire overall.
- However, areas with the highest rates of cycling were expected to have
the lowest incident rate per
unit exposure. This is based on 'strength in numbers', hypothesis that it will be
relatively safer to cycle in areas with a large number of commuters. This hypothesis
has received empirical support from the geographical literature on the subject
([Vandenbulcke et al., 2009](http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0967070X09000407)).
- Seasonal variability of traffic accidents for cyclists was expected
be different than for other road users, due
to the disproportionate impact of poor road conditions and visibility (ref).
- The diurnal distribution of incidents was expected to
be different for cyclists than for other road users ([Twisk and Reurings, 2013](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457513003278)). Explanation? ...


<!--## Literature review: the spatial distribution of cycle accidents-->

# The data

The dataset for this study is the National STATS19 data on road traffic incidents.
The data reports all incidents that took place between the 1st January 2005 until the 31st
December 2012, providing 8 years of uninterrupted records.
The structure of the raw dataset is itself quite complicated, divided into three main
files: 

- Accidents0512.csv, a 178 Mb file containing 1.3 million rows of data on the key attributes of each
incident, including time and data, location (Easting and Northing is 
provided in OSGB1936 coordinates to the nearest 1 m,
but rounded to the nearest 10 m in most cases), road type and other contextual variables
such as weather.
- Casualty0512.csv, a 74 Mb file containing 1.8 million rows on the attributes of casualties from
the incidents. These include reference to the vehicle, accident and socio-demographic
information about those injured.
- Vehicles0512.csv, a 142 Mb file containing 2.5 million rows of
data about the registered vehicles involved
in the incidents. Variables include vehicle type and other vehicle attributes demographic
details of the driver.

<!--Major updates to the structure of STATS19 data were made in 1992, when the-->

The variables of particular use for this study are summarised in Table xx below.
Henceforth, variables from these key variables will be referred to in the short form
allocated to them.

In terms of geographic data, the bulk of the analysis was conducted only on
accidents that occured within the case study zone of West Yorkshire (fig. x).

# Method

The analysis strategy was based on consideration of the
data and the hypotheses we were aiming to test.

## Estimating exposure
A major methodological challenge faced by anyone
trying to draw conclusions from road incident data
is that the underlying level of exposure is usually unknown.
Therefore, researchers can rarely tell if increases
in crashes are due to change in the riskiness of an
activity or whether simple increases in exposure - in
this case an increase in cycle use in particular areas -
is to blame.

The method used to estimate exposure varied depending on
the hypothesis being tested by a particular technique.

# Results

## Basic statistics cycle accidents in South Yorkshire

Over the entire study period, the proportion of accidents involving cyclists was 8.1%,
below the national average of 10.4%.
These figure mask great variability in time and space.

The most startling temporal trend in the data
was the near-continuous increase in the proportion of
incidents involving cyclists in West Yorkshire (Figure x).
Between 2005 and 2012, the proportion of reports involving
cyclists increased, from 6% to just over 10% of all incidents.
This trend mirrors the
national data and may be accounted for by increased uptake of cycling compared
with stagnating or declining distance travelled by other modes.

There was clear seasonal pattern in the data, with a
predominance of bicycle incidents during the
summer months, presumably due to the increased uptake of cycling in
warm and sunny weather (ref).
Dividing the year into 4 quarters, it was found that the summer months
(from April until September) were associated with a relatively high proportion
of incidents involving cyclists (10.1% on average),
compared with the colder half of the year (6.4%).

## The timing of bicycle accidents

The temporal distribution of bicycle accidents is highly correlated with that of 
road accidents overall (correlation).
However, bicycle accidents have a much 'peakier' distribution 
that all road traffic accidents, with the accident density during the afternoon
rush hour almost 50% higher for cyclists than non cyclists (fig. x).

## Deleted but kept for future ref
# in previous hypothesis section:
# The research is based on the diverse literature on risk and cycling and guided by knowledge about the information contained within the STATS19 dataset. There are many interesting research questions about risk and cycling that STATS19 cannot help answer (e.g. how do drivers' perceptions of cyclists affect the probability of collision? and what influence does experience have on the cyclist crashes?). The variables about which STATS19 provides insight are quite. A selection of some of the most relevant hypotheses to policy makers that can be tackled by analysis of STATS19 data are presented below, in rough descending order of importance and ascending order of complexity:

# old methods section
# Whilst the application of this research is targetted firmly towards sustainable transport
# planning and evaluation, the methods fit within the field of applied geography and spatial 
# analysis. As with most applied problems, 
# the method here is firmly routed in the input data, which is spatio-temporal data
# with a range of associated nominal and ordinal characteristics linked to the circumstances
# of the incident and the entities involved. Thus the main tools for analysis, beyond 
# standard tools for statistical analysis of the non spatial data (in the case of 
# comparing accidents involving cyclists with those not involving cyclists...), are 
# thus taken from the field of *spatial point pattern analysis*. 
# 
# This field has applications in many fields, notably ecology and spatial epidemiology, 
# which involves "comparing the spatial distribution of the cases [of disease] to the 
# locations of a set of controls taken at random from the population" (Bivand et al. 2013, p. 173)."
# The analogy to cycling is clear: is the spatial distribution of cycling accidents 
# (equivalent to cases)
# related to certain features on the road network (e.g. roundabouts, junctions),
# or is the distribution randomly allocated to the road network?
# 
# A range of statistical techniques falling under the umbrella term *geostatistics*
# \citep{diggle2007model}
# can be used to investigate such problems and test hypotheses, such as those set out in the 
# introduction. The geostatistical methods used in this paper are all implemented in the free
# and open source statistical programming environment R, to allow the findings to be verified 
# and reproducible by others. The provision of code used for the analysis should also 
# allow others to build on the methods presented here for better understanding the 
# spatial distribution of road traffic accidents and related phenomena. As mentioned in 
# the introduction ... the STATS19 dataset has been made available to the public by the 
# UK government in the hope that it will help raise awareness of accident hotspots for the greater good. 
# In the same spirit, it is hoped that 
# the provision of reproducible code in this project will also act in the public interest, by making
# importing, analysing and interpreting the datasets more accessible.
# 
# The spatial statistical techniques used to analyse the data (further described and implemented in 
# Section ...) are as follows:
# 
# - The *G Function* is a description of the average distances between points and their nearest 
# neighbours. It is a cumulative function of distance, displaying the proportion of points that
# have a nearest neighbour within *r* (short for radius) units of distance from itself. 
# It is a relatively simple and commonly used
# technique for point pattern analysis and is defined mathematically follows (Bivand et al. 2013):
# $$ G(r) = \frac{ \# \{d_i : d_i \leq r, \forall i \} }{n} $$
# *G(r)* is the value for any particular distance, *#* means 'count', 
# $d_i$ refers to the minimum distanc to the nearest neighbour for each point, $i$ and 
# $\forall$ means 'for all points'. By dividing by the total number of points, the 
# G function always starts at 0 (unless there are overlapping points) and ends at 1 as $r$
# increases from the minimum to the maximum distances between points. As we shall see in 
# the results section, the resulting graphic can provide much insight into the spatial clustering 
# of points.

# Old hypotheses
# - Is there any evidence to support the 'strength in numbers' hypothesis, that it will be
# relatively safer to cycle in areas with a large number of commuters?
