## Abstract

There has been much recent interest in the factors influencing cycle safety.
Within this broad topic, international differences in accident
and mortality rates, protective equipment and bicycle training have
received particular attention. Within this reseach body there
is a growing interest in environmental factors, but few studies have
focussed on geographical factors at the local level.
This paper addresses this research gap by analysing a geo-referenced
dataset of bicycle accidents, taken from the UK's STATS19 dataset
(2005 - 2013). To enable detailed analysis at the local level,
Yorkshire and the Humber was selected as the study area, which has
a low rate of cycling overall, but high rates of cycling in the cities
of York and Hull. Spatial statistics are used to characterise the
distribution of injuries to cyclists, allowing inferences about
the relative risks associated with various geographically distributed
features such as roundabouts, junctions, one-way streets, speed limits and cycle paths.
Temporal analysis identifies how these geographical risk factors intersect
with time of day, week and season. Overall we provide evidence to suggest
local-level geographical factors do play an important role in cycle safety
and suggestions of how such data could be used to increase cycle safety nationwide.
